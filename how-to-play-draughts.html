	    <h2>Instructions of playing Draughts (Checkers)</h2>
	    <p> In the WEST, the game of Draughts is also known as Checkers,  a game which has become very popular multiplayers for all ages. It has become known as a family game, but there are some players who take the game to next level and can even play it for money. </p>
	    <p>The game is played on a 64 square  checker board with 8 rows of alternating dark and light colored squares.</p>
	    <p> There are two players and each player has 12 draughts,  each with his own color. Players move their draughts on the three rows of dark squares which are next to them. And then begin playing, making only one move at a time. </p>
	    <p> The goal of the game is to make the opponent can’t  move when it comes to their turn by taking all of their pieces , or blocking them so they have nowhere to move. The  draughts can only move in a forward diagonal direction into a square without  another piece in it. If an opponent’s piece is in the next square, the player  can jump it and capture it, removing the piece from the board. But hey can only do  that if the next square is empty. Important thing to mention is that Players can't jump over their own pieces.</p>
	    <p>	      When a player come across the board  to the limit of the other player’s side, their piece will be turned into a powerful “King”. </p>
	    <p>Once a piece become a king, it will be able  to move forward and backward, giving it more chances to capture the opponents  pieces.  A king can jump as many times as  it is able to with regards to the necessary squares being unoccupied. However,  kings cannot jump over his own pieces. </p>
      <p> The game will is finish once a  player is blocked can't make any move. If both the players can’t move anywhere, the  game will end in a tie, or draw. Anyone that wants to play online will be able  to find many different gaming sites which allow them to play. They can play  against the computer, or play against other online players. There are clubs  where players get together in person to compete against each other. </p>
